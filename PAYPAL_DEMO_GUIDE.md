# PayPal Demo Payment Testing Guide

## ✅ Current Status

**PayPal Integration is Live with Real Sandbox API!**

- ✅ Real PayPal sandbox credentials configured
- ✅ PayPal API authentication successful
- ✅ Order creation working (no more mock mode)
- ✅ Demo payments ready for testing

## 🧪 Testing PayPal Demo Payments

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
Application runs at: `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 2: Navigate to Billing Page
Go to: `http://localhost:3000/billing?plan=starter`

You should see:
- ✅ "Pay with Stripe" button
- ✅ "Pay with PayPal" button

### Step 3: Click "Pay with PayPal"
This will:
1. Create a real PayPal order via sandbox API
2. Redirect to PayPal's sandbox login page
3. Allow you to complete demo payment

### Step 4: PayPal Sandbox Login
Use PayPal's test buyer accounts:
- **Email**: Any sandbox buyer account from your PayPal Developer Dashboard
- **Password**: The password for that test account

If you don't have test accounts, PayPal automatically creates them for you in the Developer Dashboard.

### Step 5: Complete Payment
1. Review payment details on PayPal
2. Click "Pay Now" or "Complete Purchase"
3. Get redirected back to your success page
4. Subscription will be activated in your database

## 🔍 PayPal Developer Dashboard Access

### View Test Accounts
1. Go to [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/)
2. Navigate to **"Sandbox" > "Accounts"**
3. You'll see pre-created test buyer and seller accounts
4. Use these credentials for testing payments

### View Transaction History
1. In PayPal Developer Dashboard
2. Go to **"Sandbox" > "Accounts"**  
3. Click on your business account
4. View transaction history for completed test payments

## 💰 Plan Pricing (USD)

The PayPal integration uses USD pricing:
- **Starter Plan**: $4.00 USD/month
- **Pro Plan**: $8.00 USD/month  
- **Business Plan**: $15.00 USD/month

*Note: PayPal doesn't support PKR directly, so USD is used*

## 🛠️ Debugging PayPal Integration

### Check Server Logs
Monitor your terminal for PayPal API calls:
```bash
✅ POST /api/billing/paypal/create-order 200 in 2370ms  # Success
❌ POST /api/billing/paypal/create-order 500           # Error
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "PayPal authentication failed"
**Solution**: Double-check your `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env.local`

**Issue**: "Order creation failed"
**Solution**: Ensure `PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox` in your environment variables

**Issue**: PayPal redirects to wrong URL
**Solution**: Check that your return/cancel URLs are correctly configured

## 🚀 Going Live (Production)

When ready for production:

1. **Create Live PayPal App**:
   - In PayPal Developer Dashboard
   - Create new app with "Live" environment
   - Get production Client ID and Secret

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_live_client_id
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_live_client_secret
   PAYPAL_MODE=live
   ```

3. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test in sandbox before switching to live mode!
